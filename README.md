# FindDefault: Prediction of Credit Card Fraud

## Introduction
Credit cards are widely used for online purchases and payments, making them a convenient tool for managing personal finances. However, this convenience comes with a risk: credit card fraud. Fraudulent activities can cause significant financial loss to both customers and financial institutions. This project, titled **FindDefault**, focuses on predicting fraudulent credit card transactions. The primary goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately distinguishes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, thus helping credit card companies minimize losses and protect their customers.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset includes transactions from a two-day period, totaling 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent. This results in a highly imbalanced dataset, with fraudulent transactions making up only 0.172% of all transactions.

**Key Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Total Transactions:** 284,807
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** 492
- **Class Imbalance:** Fraudulent transactions account for 0.172% of the data.

The dataset contains various features, such as transaction amount, timestamp, and anonymized numerical features, which are derived from the original data to protect sensitive information.

## Project Workflow
The project is structured into the following key phases:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - **Objective:** Gain insights into the data, identify patterns, relationships, and trends.
   - **Steps:**
     - Load the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
     - Generate summary statistics to observe central tendencies, variability, and distribution of data.
     - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and relationships using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
     - Identify any significant patterns or anomalies, such as correlations between features and the target variable (fraud).

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   - **Objective:** Prepare the dataset for modeling by addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
   - **Steps:**
     - Check for missing values and handle them if necessary (e.g., imputation or removal).
     - Identify and address outliers that could distort model performance.
     - Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
     - Encode categorical variables, if any, using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### 3. Handling Imbalanced Data
   - **Objective:** Address the class imbalance to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
   - **Approaches:**
     - **Undersampling:** Randomly reduce the number of non-fraudulent transactions to match the count of fraudulent transactions.
     - **Oversampling:** Increase the number of fraudulent transactions to match the count of non-fraudulent transactions using techniques like Random Oversampling.
     - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** Generate synthetic samples of the minority class to balance the dataset.
     - **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling):** Similar to SMOTE but focuses on creating synthetic samples in regions with low density of minority class samples.

### 4. Feature Engineering
   - **Objective:** Enhance model performance by creating new features or transforming existing ones.
   - **Steps:**
     - Create new features that capture important patterns or relationships not directly available in the original dataset.
     - Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA if necessary to reduce feature space and improve model efficiency.
     - Transform features to reduce skewness, normalize distributions, or handle categorical data.

### 5. Model Selection
   - **Objective:** Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for the classification task.
   - **Considered Models:**
     - **Logistic Regression:** A simple yet effective model for binary classification tasks.
     - **Decision Trees:** A model that can capture complex relationships between features.
     - **XGBoost:** A powerful ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners to form a strong predictive model.

### 6. Model Training and Validation
   - **Objective:** Train the model on the training dataset and validate its performance on the validation set.
   - **Steps:**
     - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.
     - Train the models using the training set and perform cross-validation to assess the robustness of the model.
     - Tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV to find the optimal model parameters.

### 7. Model Evaluation
   - **Objective:** Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and choose the best-performing model.
   - **Performance Metrics:**
     - **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified transactions.
     - **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
     - **Recall:** The proportion of actual fraudulent transactions that were correctly identified.
     - **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
     - **ROC-AUC:** The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, measuring the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
   - **Visualization:** Use a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance and understand the types of errors it makes.

### 8. Model Deployment
   - **Objective:** Deploy the best-performing model in a production environment for real-time fraud detection.
   - **Steps:**
     - Serialize the model using the pickle module to save it for future use.
     - Example code snippet to save the model:
       ```python
       with open('load_best_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
           pickle.dump(load_best_model, file)
       ```
     - Deploy the model to a production environment where it can be used to make real-time predictions on new transactions.
